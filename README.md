# Templater

## About
Templater is a CLI for creating projects from a template.  

The intention of this project is to get any project off the ground as fast as possible. It is not intended to be opinionated but to serve as another tool in the tool chest. 

## Installation
Eventually this will be shipped with homebrew, but not until we get to Beta or V1

Until then you can: 
git clone git@github.com:maschall/cookbook
bundle install --binstubs
rake homebrew
